As Kyle walks home from the grocery story, a strange breeze make him wonder 
if something is amiss. He soon notices there is no one on the street with him. 
And as he reaches for his phone, the sky starts to turn dark and a storm starts 
to form. Living in Kansas, he's used to the tornados, but there was something 
different about this one.

He tries to call his parents to come pick him up but there is no one on the
other end to answer the call. His only choice is to run home, but the weather
is worsening quickly. Quickly, Kyle has to shield his eyes as the wind starts
to blow dust in his face. Shortly after that, breathing becomes difficult.
With still over a mile left to run, and visibility quickly becoming a problem,
Kyle decided to dip into a resaturant to seek shelter.
